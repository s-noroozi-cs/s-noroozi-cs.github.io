  Spring – k8s
•	service discovery through Spring Cloud Kubernetes
o	Kubernetes exposes the service as a collection of endpoints

•	load balancing using Spring Cloud Kubernetes Ribbon
o	Spring Cloud Kubernetes Ribbon uses this feature to load balance between the different endpoints of a service.
o	In a microservices environment, we generally need the list of pods where our service is replicated in order to perform load-balancing. This is accomplished by using a mechanism provided by Spring Cloud Kubernetes Ribbon. This mechanism can automatically discover and reach all the endpoints of a specific service, and subsequently, it populates a Ribbon ServerList with information about the endpoints.

•	configuration management and injecting Kubernetes ConfigMaps and secrets to application pods using Spring Cloud Kubernetes Config
o	ConfigMaps provided by Kubernetes – provided that we intend to use it for non-sensitive, unencrypted information only. 
o	Alternatively, if the information we want to share is sensitive, then we should opt to use Secrets instead.

Service mesh
In software architecture, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for facilitating service-to-service communications between services or microservices, using a proxy. A dedicated communication layer can provide a number of benefits, such as providing observability into communications, providing secure connections, or automating retries and backoff for failed requests.
